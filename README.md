# Predicting-Smartphone-Adiction-using-machine-learning
In today's digital age, smartphone addiction has major consequences for mental health, productivity, and social ties. The project "Predicting Smartphone Addiction Through Machine Learning" examines behavioral, psychological, and use patterns—such as screen time, app usage, and surveys—and uses machine learning to classify addiction risk as Low, Moderate, or High. It also provides practical tips to help lessen reliance, such as setting screen time limitations. The system, built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides smooth interaction while fostering awareness and healthy digital habits by combining technology and psychology.
